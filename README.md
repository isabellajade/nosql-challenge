## Module 12 Challenge
For this project I used PyMongo to evaluate ... [ADD MORE]

## Part 1 | Set Up
In order to set up for this project I imported the JSON file with the data used for my analysis to MongoDB from my terminal. 

## Part 2 | Updating the Database
For this project I updated:

- Added a new restaurant to the database
- Updated the BusinessTypeID for a new restaurant
- Removed all establishments within the Dover Local Authority
- Changed the datatype of longitude and latitude to decimal numbers

## Part 3 | Exploratory Analysis
For each of the questions below I displayed the number of documents contained in the results, use pprint to display the first document, converted the results to a Pandas DataFrame, printed the number of rows in said DataFrame, and displayed the first 10 rows.

The questions answered with my analysis were:

1. Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?
2. Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?
3. What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of '5', sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?
4. How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Sort the results from highest to lowest, and print out the top ten local authority areas.
